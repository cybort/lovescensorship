    <h1>In April, <em>{{ page.politician.name }}</em> sold off our Internet privacy. Now {{ page.pronoun.subject }} wants to censor your Internet.</h1>

    <p>{{ page.politician.name }} has <a href="{{ page.taken.link }}" target="_blank">taken</a> {{ page.taken.amount }} in campaign contributions from giant mainstream media and telecom companies like Comcast -- who own MSNBC -- in exchange for supporting their policies <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/06/attack-net-neutrality-attack-free-speech" target="_blank">pushing</a> for more Internet censorship, price gouging for consumers, and the ability to control what we can see and do on the web. Earlier this year, {{ page.pronoun.subject }} <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/29/15100620/congress-fcc-isp-web-browsing-privacy-fire-sale" target="_blank">{{ page.legislation.verb }}</a> a disturbingly sleazy bill to let Internet providers to sell our web browsing history to advertisers without our permission. Now, {{ page.pronoun.subject }}’s <a href="{{ page.supporting.link }}" target="_blank">supporting</a> the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) plan to kill online free speech by <a href="https://www.newsmax.com/DavidGoodfriend/comcast-fcc-pai/2015/04/26/id/786478/" target="_blank">letting Internet providers</a> block or slow down entire websites while speeding up their own content. If this plan passes and net neutrality dies, liberal groups could pressure sympathetic companies like Comcast and AT&amp;T to slow or censor any conservative website. It would be a disaster for freedom of expression. Add your name to tell {{ page.pronoun.object }} {{ page.pronoun.subject }} won’t get away with it.
