# *Marsha Blackburn* sold off our Internet privacy. Now she wants censorship.

{% include petition.html heading="Tell Marsha Blackburn:" subhead="You can’t hide from your constituents. We can all see your corruption. I’ll never vote for you if you continue to support the FCC’s attack on free speech and the Internet." image="images/marshablackburn.png" caption="Marsha Blackburn" %}

## Marsha Blackburn bills herself as a conservative, but when it comes to free speech she sides with globalists and liberals.

Blackburn has [taken](http://www.vocativ.com/415350/house-rep-pushing-to-set-back-online-privacy-rakes-in-industry-funds/) nearly $700,000 in campaign contributions from giant mainstream media and telecom companies like Comcast -- who own MSNBC -- in exchange for **supporting** their policies [pushing](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/06/attack-net-neutrality-attack-free-speech) for more Internet censorship, price gouging for consumers, and the ability to control what we can see, and what we can say, on the web. Earlier this year, she [sponsored](https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/29/15100620/congress-fcc-isp-web-browsing-privacy-fire-sale) a disturbingly sleazy bill to let Internet providers to sell our web browsing history to advertisers without our permission. Now, she’s [supporting](http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2017/05/31/blackburn-fccs-rollback-net-neutrality-rules-a-positive-step/356558001/) the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) plan to kill online free speech by [letting Internet providers](https://www.newsmax.com/DavidGoodfriend/comcast-fcc-pai/2017/04/26/id/786478/) block or slow down sites like Drudge and Breitbart while speeding up their own content. **Add your name to tell her she won’t get away with it.**
